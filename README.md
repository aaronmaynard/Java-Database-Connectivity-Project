The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API is the industry standard for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a wide range of databases SQL databases and other tabular data sources, such as spreadsheets or flat files. This project is an exercise on the usage of the API. This is the source code to a JDBC project that was done to test our knowledge on incorporating and utilizing an AWS DMBS.

<summary>Database Information</summary>
The database is manages by Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use a local database, which you may find much easier for debugging purposes; dropping and creating a new database should be instant. The schema for the database can be found in the root directory for the project.  AWS RDS information is as follows:  
Engine - MySQL  
Use Case - Dev/Test - MySQL  
DB Engine Version - mysql 5.6.39
